<app-card title="About Me">
  <p class="text-base pl-6 text-red-500">
    As all the information provided other side of this CV, I just tell what are
    not mention there, I love to code whenever I found free time (it comes from
    my love of for the mathematics) from my educational life and my family, as I
    dream always to be a better developer with learning new something daily from
    the internet and I’m fond of learning new programming languages and new
    technologies and new framework. I’m very much interested in UI/UX design in
    software and mainly web development and some time I also apply my custom
    thinking to build something new and unique.
